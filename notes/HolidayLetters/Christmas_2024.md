# Christmas 2024 Letter

## Drafting

A year of plenty, and then some more, \
One for the books, twenty-twenty four. \
Our lil' blue house became a new home \
for another crazy dog and a mix of genomes

First, we kissed, then we wed \
Called the stork, from our bed \
God blessed we've been \
With our little Jacquelyn.

About to awake is twenty twenty-five \
Year of the snake, time of our lives. \
We'll be nesting, resting, and breasting, \
But in between, come by and sing.

### Christmas 2022

In our little house, oh so blue, \
Ends the year twenty twenty-two. \
A lot has happened! Too much to list! \
But here are a few: first, we kissed--

Then the little blue house got greener, \
The kitchen got a whole lot cleaner, \
The windowsills became well-read, \
And twice the dog hair was shed.

Now, what's to come in twenty twenty-three? \
We wish you the best, whatever comes to be. \
And we'll be here, so y'all come and visit, \
even if you only stay a minute.
