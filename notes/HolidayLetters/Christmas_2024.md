# Christmas 2024 Letter

A year of plenty, and then some more, \
One for the books, twenty-twenty four. \
Our lil' blue house became a new home \
Another crazy dog and a mix of genomes

First, we kissed, then we wed \
Got a call from the stork while in our bed: \
"This December, God blessed you'll be \
With a little one, sweet Jackie"

About to awake is twenty twenty-five \
Year of the snake, time of our lives. \
To be filled with nesting, resting, and breasting; \
Perhaps in the spring, come see the best thing.

James, Riley, Jacquelyn, Dakota, and Crab Elder

### Christmas 2022

In our little house, oh so blue, \
Ends the year twenty twenty-two. \
A lot has happened! Too much to list! \
But here are a few: first, we kissed--

Then the little blue house got greener, \
The kitchen got a whole lot cleaner, \
The windowsills became well-read, \
And twice the dog hair was shed.

Now, what's to come in twenty twenty-three? \
We wish you the best, whatever comes to be. \
And we'll be here, so y'all come and visit, \
even if you only stay a minute.
